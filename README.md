# Calendar Library Selection Analysis

## Introduction

This repo provides a detailed analysis of various calendar libraries considered for integration into our project. The evaluation is based on a set of predefined criteria tailored to meet both technical requirements and user experience expectations.

## Evaluation Criteria

The following features and considerations were central to our analysis:

- **Download Count & Issue Tracking**: Assessment of library popularity and active maintenance through GitHub statistics.
- **Dependency Review**: Verification of dependencies to avoid undesirable affiliations and minimize bloat.
- **Customization Flexibility**: Ability to customize aspects like date ranges, input formatting, and UI components.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring that the library performs well on mobile devices.
- **Custom Components & Validation**: Support for adding custom components and implementing custom validation logic.
- **Accessibility & Localization**: Compliance with accessibility standards and support for multiple languages.

## Options Considered

### Dropped Options

- **airbnb/react-dates**
  - **Repository**: [GitHub](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates)
  - **Reason for Dropping**: No updates in the past 2 years; depends on moment.js.

- **react-multi-date-picker**
  - **Repository**: [GitHub](https://github.com/YourLink)
  - **Reason for Dropping**: Developers based in regions conflicting with project policies.

- **atlaskit/datetime-picker**
  - **Repository**: [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit)
  - **Reason for Dropping**: Overly reliant on Atlassian's design kit.
